Soon, we purchased 11 acres of land on the outskirts of Maai Mahiu, Kenya, and rehabilitated it with native trees, plants, and landscaping. It was here where we built our Maker Studio."

We provide them with access to income in a way that is supportive of their culture and lifestyle."

It was there that he met our other Co-Founder, Jeremiah Kuria. The two forged a powerful friendship based on faith, development, and purpose. These conversations led to standing lunches every Thursday, where they brainstormed ways to serve the local community, especially those living on society's margins.\n<br><br>\nDriven by their shared vision, they created a Center for children with special needs, providing them with medical care and life-changing therapy.\n<br><br>\nBefore the Center, care giving was a full-time job for the mothers of children with special needs. With more time, nine of these Mums started a new conversation with Jeremiah and Zane: “Now that our kids are being cared for five days a week, can you help us do something productive with our time?”\n<br><br>\nWhat started twenty years ago as nine women learning to sew on manual sewing machines has now transformed into a thriving social enterprise employing over 150 full-time Makers that are changing their lives and the world."
