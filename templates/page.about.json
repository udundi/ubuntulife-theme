Soon, we purchased 11 acres of land on the outskirts of Maai Mahiu, Kenya, and rehabilitated it with native trees, plants, and landscaping. It was here where we built our Maker Studio."

We provide them with access to income in a way that is supportive of their culture and lifestyle."

        "history_text": "It all started when our Co-Founder & CEO, Zane Wilemon, purchased a one-way ticket to Kenya in search of the meaning of life. It was there that he met our other Co-Founder, Jeremiah Kuria. The two forged a powerful friendship as they shared life and talked about faith, development and purpose. These conversations led to standing lunches every Thursday where they began to brainstorm on ways to serve the local community, especially those living on the margins of society.\n<br><br>\nDriven by their shared vision to help the local community, they created a center for children with special needs, providing them with medical care and life-changing therapy.\n<br><br>\nCaring for these children had been a full-time job for their mothers before the center came into their lives. Soon, nine of these Mums started a new conversation with Jeremiah and Zane: “Now that our kids are being cared for 5 days a week, can you help us do something productive with our time?”\n<br><br>\nWhat started out as nine women learning to sew on manual sewing machines has now transformed into a thriving social enterprise employing over 150 full-time Makers that are changing their lives and the world."
